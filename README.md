# Diabetes_Prediction
Perform EDA and develop predictive models to understand the relationships between various features and diabetes outcomes.

 Our dataset is  from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal of this assignment is to build a predictive model that can diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements. Our goal is to create a tool that can help identify whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on some health-related measurements.
 
Questions I used EDA to answer
General Diabetes Statistics:
What is the distribution of diabetes outcomes (1 or 0) in the dataset?
What is the overall prevalence of diabetes in the dataset?

Correlation and Relationships:
How do Glucose levels vary for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals?
Is there a correlation between BMI and diabetes outcome?
What is the relationship between Age and diabetes prevalence?

Impact of Pregnancy:
How does the number of pregnancies affect the likelihood of diabetes?
Is there a difference in Glucose levels for women with different numbers of pregnancies?

Blood Pressure and Skin Thickness:
How does Blood Pressure vary for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals?
Does Skin Thickness have a significant impact on diabetes outcome?

Insulin and BMI:
How are Insulin levels distributed among diabetic and non-diabetic patients?
Is there a noticeable difference in BMI for individuals with diabetes?

Genetic Factors:
Does the Diabetes Pedigree Function vary significantly for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals?
Are there specific age groups where diabetes tends to be more prevalent?
